"""Chamber light for the camera (#1655).

A printer kept dark between uses gives black live views and black snapshots.
The app setting ``camera_light_mode`` picks the printers this applies to:
"off", "all", or "selected" (those with ``Printer.camera_light_auto``). For
those, every camera use holds the light: the first
holder turns it on, and once the last one lets go it is turned off again after
a short grace, so a reconnecting viewer or the camera wall's periodic
snapshots don't make it flash.

Bambuddy only ever turns off a light it turned on itself. A light that was
already on stays on, and switching the light by hand hands it back to the user.

Layer timelapse, the Obico check and the in-print frame bank don't hold the
light: they capture all through a print, and the light would flash with every
frame.
