"""Price a print from its spools when it starts, not only when it ends (#3261).

``archive.py`` prices an archive at creation from the built-in Filament catalogue
matched on the primary type, falling back to the global default rate. The
spools that actually feed the print only price it at completion -- the
built-in inventory in ``usage_tracker.on_print_complete``, Spoolman in
``spoolman_tracking._apply_spool_cost_to_archive`` (#2591). In between, the
archive card showed the placeholder, and anyone writing the cost down while a
long print ran recorded a number that later changed without notice.

This runs the completion-time pricing once at print start, on the 3MF's
per-slot estimates instead of charged grams: each slot is priced at the spool
in the tray it is mapped to, grams no spool could price are covered at the
default rate, and the result replaces the placeholder. The figure is still an
estimate -- a failed or stopped print ends up cheaper -- and the archive card
says so while the print runs.

Only mappings that are trustworthy at print start are used: the print
command's own ``ams_mapping``, the queue item's stored mapping, and a colour
match against the trays loaded right now. The printer's ``mapping`` field is
deliberately not read here: it still describes the previous job until the
printer pushes an update (see ``spoolman_tracking._resolve_slot_to_tray_fallback``).
With no trustworthy mapping, nothing is priced and the placeholder stays.

Strictly best-effort. Nothing here may fail a print start.
