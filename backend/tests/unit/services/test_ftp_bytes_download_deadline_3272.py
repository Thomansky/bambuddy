"""The whole-file bytes download gives a big file time to arrive (#3272).

A flat 300 s cap failed a 75 MB P1S timelapse that took 358 s on a healthy
link, and every retry started the file again from scratch. The deadline now
follows the listing's size at the pessimistic floor rate, with no ceiling: the
callers that pass a size hold no DB connection across the transfer.
